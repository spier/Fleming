```
You are now ready to start developing your own functions. Please remember to follow Felmming's development lifecycle to maintain clarity and efficiency for a fully robust self serving platform. 

5) For better readability of code is would be useful to enable black and isort on autosave by simply adding this to the VSCode user settings json(Ctrl + Shft + P):

```
    {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "python.formatting.provider": "black",
        "python.formatting.blackArgs": [
            "--line-length=119"
        ],
        "python.sortImports.args": [
            "--profile",
            "black"
        ],
        "[python]": {
            "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
                "source.organizeImports": true
            }
        }
    }
```
